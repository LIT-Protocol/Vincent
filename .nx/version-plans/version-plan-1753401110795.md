### Fix tool failure response cases

- Ensures that policy denial disables checking the tool result against its fail schema in the toolClient, because it will always be undefined :)
- Ensures that `context` is returned in the response from the toolClient.execute() method in cases where the tool response was a runtime or schemaValidationError
