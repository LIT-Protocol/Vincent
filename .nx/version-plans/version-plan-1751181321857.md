#### Tool-SDK v2 support

- Updated policy to use `@lit-protocol/vincent-tool-sdk@2.0.0`
- Removed `packageName` from the policy config; it is now only needed on the BundledVincentPolicy, and is computed during bundling.
- Removed `src/lib/lit-action.ts` - this file is now generated during bundling
