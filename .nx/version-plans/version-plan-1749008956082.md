vincent-rest-api: patch

Removed the `AppDef` schema to reduce our schema complexity and added`activeVersion` to the `CreateApp` definition, similiar to how we moved `appId`
Fixed an import preventing schema generation
Rename CreateApp -> AppDef
Removed `EditApp` schema, have it use the new `AppDef` and we'll hide `appId` on the form for the FE
