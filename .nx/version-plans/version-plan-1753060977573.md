### Create vincentToolClient namespace

Previously, `getVincentToolClient()` and `disconnectVincentToolClients()` were exported from the root of the `vincent-app-sdk` package.
These methods, along with several other methods are now exported from the `@lit-protocol/app-sdk/toolClient` namespace

```typescript
import {
  getVincentToolClient,
  disconnectVincentToolClients,
  isToolResponseFailure,
  isToolResponseRuntimeFailure,
  isToolResponseSchemaValidationFailure,
  isToolResponseSuccess,
} from '@lit-protocol/app-sdk/toolClient';
```
