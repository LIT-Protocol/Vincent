#### uiSchema and jsonSchema handling

- Updated registry backend processing to import `uiSchema` and `jsonSchema` values for policies from `dist/src/inputUiSchema.json` instead of `dist/src/generated/vincent-policy-metadata.json`.
- These values aren't really generated code and aren't computed metadata; they are managed by the policy author so having them in the same file that is generated by bundling logic was sub-optimal
