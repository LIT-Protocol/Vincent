#### Add SIWE authentication definitions

- Defined a new `siweAuth` securitySchema and applied it to all PUT, POST and DELETE endpoints
- SIWE auth is a custom Authorization scheme, using the prefix `SIWE:`, but is considered an `apiKey` semantically for compatibility purposes
- Implemented Metamask integration for getting SIWEs in the RapiDoc UI

### Define tags per endpoint to support automatic cache invalidation

- Defined `tags` for all endpoints
- The RTK query client will now automatically refetch data for any existing subscriptions when a mutation occurs
- The tags are extremely simplistic, generic, and pessimistic. Basically, when an entity changes we reload all data for all entities of the same time. We will make this less pessimistic by using `.enhanceEndpoints` in a follow-up release.
