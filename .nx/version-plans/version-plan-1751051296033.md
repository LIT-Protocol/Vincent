#### Add SIWE authentication definitions

- Defined a new `siweAuth` securitySchema and applied it to all PUT, POST and DELETE endpoints
- SIWE auth is a custom Authorization scheme, using the prefix `SIWE:`, but is considered an `apiKey` semantically for compatibility purposes
- Implemented Metamask integration for getting SIWEs in the RapiDoc UI
