### Move `packageName` from `createVincent[tool|policy] to `asBundledVincent[tool|policy]`

- Previously, you needed to provide the `packageName` for tools and policies when defining them using `createVincentTool()` or `createVincentPolicy()`.
- Now, the packageName is added to the `BundledVincentTool` and `BundledVincentPolicy`, which is usually generated code.
- Default tooling will generally look up the `packageName` automatically from the closest `package.json`'s `name` property.
