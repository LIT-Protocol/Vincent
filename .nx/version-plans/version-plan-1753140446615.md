#### Support dev and prod contracts

- Refactored to export methods for creating a ContractClient instance instead of flat, raw methods list
- `getTestClient({ signer })` for CI or dev usage where you don't care about the data being kept around
- `getClient({ signer })` for production usage where you care about the data

#### Internal method for interacting with local chain instances

- `clientFromContract({ contract })` allows a completely custom contract to be provided, for cases where we may running entirely local chain instance w/ custom addresses or contract implementations.
