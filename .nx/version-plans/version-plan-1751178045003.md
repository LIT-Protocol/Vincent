#### Migrate packageName from PolicyConfig to BundledVincentPolicy

- `createVincentPolicy` no longer requires the `packageName` argument.
- BundledVincentPolicy now tracks both ipfsCid and the packageName in a `metadata` object
- Bundling tooling can now provide the correct `packageName` value by reading it from `project.json`
