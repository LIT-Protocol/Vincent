#### API changes for v1.0

- Numbers instead of strings for things that are numeric but won't be big enough to require BigInt
- Renamed some arguments to be more explicit e.g. 'xxx'->xxxAddress
- getAppsByManager() -> getAppsByManagerAddress()
- getAppByDelegatee() -> getAppByDelegateeAddress()
- Modified interfaces that took and returned pkpTokenIds to take and return pkpEthAddresses instead
- Used partial ABI of pkpRouter contract to avoid bringing in multiple MB of contracts-sdk ABIs
- getDelegatedAgentPkpTokenIds() -> getDelegatedPkpEthAddresses()
- getAllRegisteredAgentPkps() -> getAllRegisteredAgentPkpEthAddresses()
- Optional pageOpts for fetching pages of pkpEthAddresses, with optional offset and limit - default page size is 100
- `overrides` is now correctly defined as an Ethers.Overrides type
- Added some internal types for contract results to be sure we're sane in our usage
- Removed `success` property from responses of methods that returned `{ txHash, success }` - it was redundant - there was no way `success` could ever be anything other than `true`.
- Removed logic in `registerNextVersion() that would return `-1` for newAppVersion in cases where we couldn't identify what it was, and instead threw an explicit error
- Return an empty array for collection methods that might have no results instead of reverting
