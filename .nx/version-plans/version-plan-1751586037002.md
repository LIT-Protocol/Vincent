#### Implement e2e test suite to verify result handling

- Implemented modified (parameterized) esbuild and deploy-to-ipfs scripts from our existing tools that will bundle and deploy all of the tools that are locally defined in the `toolpolicies-e2e` project
- Defined E2E fixture tools for verifying fail and success behaviour of tools that are executed using the `VincentToolClient`.
- Added `responseTests.spec.ts` file that runs `precheck()` and `execute()` for every fixture tool and verifies the results are the correct shape
- Verifies both with and without schema cases with and without results, and case where an error is thrown from inside the lifecycle function
