### Implement supported Vincent Tool API range

Added basic Tool API handling to ensure tools & policies are only used by compatible tools and policies, and with the correct version of the vincentToolClient / app-sdk

- Added a new jsParam when VincentToolClient calls a tool, `vincentToolApiVersion`
- LIT action wrappers for tools + policies compare `vincentToolApiVersion` to match the major semver range the handler was built with from the tool-sdk
- vincentToolHandler() is responsible for passing along the value when it evaluates supported policies
