### JWT authentication

#### App owners, tool and policy authors now use JWT authentication via PKPs to auth with the registry

- Implemented express authentication using the new non-app-specific JWT code from `app-sdk`
- All edits to apps, tools and policies are now based on the `pkp.ethAddress` in the JWT instead of a signed SIWE
