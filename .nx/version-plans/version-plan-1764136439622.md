Adds a `enableSmartAccount` flag to the `setupVincentDevelopmentEnvironment`. Supports `safe`, `crossmint` and `zerodev` smart accounts. When the flag is set, the development environment will create a Smart Account owned by the `agentWalletOwner` (currently owns the Agent PKP for development). It will then add the Agent PKP as a signer on the Smart Account.
