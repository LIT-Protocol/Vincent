Adds a `enableSmartAccount` flag to the `setupVincentDevelopmentEnvironment`. Defaults to `false`. When `true`, this will create a Smart Account owned by the `agentWalletOwner` (currently owns the Agent PKP for development). It will then add the Agent PKP as a signer on the Smart Account, returning the `address` and the `serializedPermissionAccount`.
