### Support JWTs that are not app-specific

This release adds support for general authentication JWTs that are not tied to a specific app. This is a breaking change that requires updates to code that uses the JWT validation functions.

#### API Changes

- `verify` and `decode` functions now accept object parameters instead of separate parameters
  - Their return values are strongly typed based on whether `requiredAppId` is provided.
  - They throw if `requiredAppId` is provided but the jwt is either not app-specific or the app id on the token doesn't match the `requiredAppId`
- `appId` type changed from `string` to `number` in WebAuthClient configuration
- WebAuthClient now throws an error if the `appId` it was configured with isn't in the JWT it decodes

#### New Functions

- `isGeneralJWT`: Type guard to check if a JWT is Vincent JWT that has no app associated
- `isAppSpecificJWT`: Type guard to check if a JWT is a vincent JWT that is app-specific
- `assertIsVincentJWT`: Assertion function to validate if a decoded JWT is a valid Vincent JWT
- `getAppInfo`: Convenience method that returns the app ID and version from an app-specific JWT's payload
- `getPKPInfo`: Convenience method that returns PKP information from any Vincent JWT's payload

#### New Types

- `VincentJWT`: Interface for a decoded Vincent JWT without app-specific details (general authentication)
- `VincentJWTAppSpecific`: Interface for a decoded app-specific Vincent JWT
- `BaseVincentJWTPayload`: Payload that contains always-present properties on all Vincent JWTs
- `VincentAppSpecificJWTPayload`: Extends VincentJWTPayload with app-specific information
