title: 'Hyperliquid Automation'
---

Vincent enables prop traders, DEX aggregators, and exchanges to automate Hyperliquid trading with complete non-custodial control.

## The Manual Approval Bottleneck

Trading strategies generate signals 24/7. Manual approvals don't.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Strategy generates signal">
    Your algorithm identifies a profitable trade
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for signature">
    User must manually approve the transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="User unavailable">
    They're offline, asleep, or in a different timezone
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market moves">
    **Opportunity expires. Trade not executed.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Manual signature requirements limit execution speed and trading volume. Vincent eliminates this bottleneck.
</Warning>

## Enter Vincent Agent Wallets

Vincent Agent Wallets provide non-custodial delegation infrastructure for Hyperliquid. Users grant scoped trading permissions to your application once - you build the automation logic, Vincent handles secure execution while users maintain complete asset control.

Think of it as delegation infrastructure: users set boundaries, you build strategies that operate within them automatically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx Before Vincent
  // Multiple signatures per trade
  await hyperliquid.approve(order)      // User must sign
  await hyperliquid.placeOrder(order)   // User must sign
  await hyperliquid.confirm(order)      // User must sign
  // Limited to user availability
  ```
  ```jsx With Vincent
  // One-time delegation, your automation runs continuously
  await hyperliquidAbilityClient.execute({
  order: {
  asset: 0,
  orderType: { limit: { tif: "Gtc" } },
  ...
},
{ delegatorAddress }
})
  // Your application executes without additional signatures
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User grants permissions">
    User approves scoped delegation - defining exactly which actions your app can perform on Hyperliquid
  </Step>
  <Step title="You build automation">
    Your application logic executes trades programmatically without requiring additional signatures
  </Step>
  <Step title="User maintains control">
    Users can monitor activity, adjust permissions, or revoke access anytime
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Users delegate once. Your automation runs continuously.
</Tip>

## Why Trading Operations Choose Vincent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Eliminate Execution Delays">
    **The Problem:** Manual signatures create latency between signal generation and execution

    **With Vincent:**
    - Build automation that executes trades immediately when signals fire
    - Operate across all timezones and market hours
    - Scale to hundreds of daily transactions per user
    - No waiting for user availability

    **Result:** Capture more opportunities, eliminate timing-based slippage
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Maintain Compliance">
    **The Problem:** Traditional delegation requires custody handoff or private key sharing

    **With Vincent:**
    - Users never transfer asset custody
    - Scoped permissions with explicit boundaries
    - Full transaction auditability on-chain
    - Instant revocation capability

    **Result:** Build automation without compliance risk
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Focus on Strategy">
    **The Problem:** Building delegation infrastructure is time-consuming

    **With Vincent:**
    - Delegation infrastructure handled for you
    - TypeScript SDK for building execution logic
    - Optional smart contract policies for custom delegation permissions
    - Focus on strategy, not infrastructure

    **Result:** Build automated strategies faster

## Integration

<Note>
  This is an example. I'll change it when writing the Hyperliquid ability page.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    ```bash
    npm install @vincent/sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the client">
    ```jsx
    import { createAbilityClient } from '@vincent/sdk'

    const hyperliquidAbilityClient = await createAbilityClient({
    protocol: 'hyperliquid',
    // Configuration details
  })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your automation">
    ```jsx
    // Your automation logic
    await hyperliquidAbilityClient.execute({
    order: {
    asset: 0,
    orderType: { limit: { tif: "Gtc" } },
    isBuy: true,
    limitPx: "2000",
    sz: "1"
  },
  { delegatorAddress: user.address }
  })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Bottom Line

Manual approval processes don't scale. Vincent provides the infrastructure to build trading automation that executes at machine speed while users sleep - without asking them to trust you with their assets.
