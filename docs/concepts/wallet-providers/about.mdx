Vincent enables wallet providers to integrate app delegation directly into their wallets. Users can authorize Vincent apps to perform blockchain operations on their behalf while wallets maintain full custody and control through policy-governed permissions.

## Key Features

- **No Custody Risk:** Users' keys never leave the wallet—Vincent uses delegated PKP signing
- **Policy Enforcement:** Wallets help users set spending limits and contract allowlists
- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Works with both ERC-4337 Smart Accounts and traditional EOAs
- **Transparent Validation:** All operations validated in Lit's TEE before signing
- **User Control:** Instant revocation and granular permission management
