Automate trading on Hyperliquid without relying on custodial, fully-privileged API wallets or sub-accounts.

With Vincent's granular, revocable, and non-custodial delegation system, you can build safe, policy enforced trading apps that execute 24/7 while users retain full control over their funds.

## Why Vincent for Hyperliquid?

**The Problem:** Hyperliquid enables automated trading 24/7 with sub-accounts and API wallets, but these accounts are fully-privileged. Anyone with the account secret can execute any trade and control all funds in that account. There are no built-in mechanisms to set spending limits, symbol allowlists, or other granular permissions.

**The Solution:** Vincent replaces all-or-nothing sub-accounts and API wallets with granular, revocable, non-custodial delegation. Users approve exactly what your app is allowed to do and Vincent Policies automatically enforce spending caps, asset restrictions, leverage limits, and other user customized guardrails. Your app can trade 24/7 on behalf of Vincent Users, but the user always retains full custody and ultimate control over all their assets.

<Note>
  Key Point: Hyperliquid already enables automated trading via API Wallets. Vincent's value is in
  providing **non-custodial, granular, policy enforced delegation** - turning full privilege access
  into least privilege access with user defined guardrails.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Vincent App">
    You create your Vincent App that utilizes the Hyperliquid Ability and any of the other
    registered Vincent Abilities to perform a service.
  </Step>

<Step title="Vincent Users Permit Your App">
  After publishing your App to the Vincent Registry, Vincent Users permit your App via the Vincent
  Connect UI, configuring which Vincent Policies you've chosen to support, setting limitations on
  how your App can act on their behalf.
</Step>

  <Step title="Your App Executes Trades on Behalf of the Vincent User">
    Your App now has the authorization to execute the Hyperliquid Ability on behalf of the Vincent User, executing trades within the limits set by the Vincent Policies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Copy Trading Platforms" icon="users">
  Users delegate to your Vincent App to mirror top traders' positions, setting guardrails like “max
  5 ETH per trade” or allowed markets, with instant revocation anytime.
</Card>

<Card title="Trading Bots & Signal Services" icon="robot">
  Telegram/Discord bots execute trades without ever handling secrets. Users define their own limits
  such as max position size or daily loss caps, and the bot executes within them.
</Card>

<Card title="Multi-Protocol Strategy Engines" icon="arrows-rotate">
  Execute arbitrage or hedging strategies across protocols like Hyperliquid, Aave, Uniswap, and
  more. One Vincent Wallet controls all integrations with unified permissions.
