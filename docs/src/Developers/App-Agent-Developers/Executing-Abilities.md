# Using the Vincent Ability Client to Execute Abilities

As a Vincent App Developer, you need a structured way to execute Vincent Abilities for your Vincent App Users.

The Vincent App SDK provides a streamlined, type-safe interface called the Vincent Ability Client which manages the entire execution flow of a Vincent Ability. From handling the precheck validations to confirm all prerequisites are met and Ability execution is likely to succeed, to executing the Ability's logic to perform the permitted actions on behalf of the Vincent User.

This guide will walk you through the process of using the Ability Client to execute Vincent Abilities.

# How the Vincent Ability Client Works

The Vincent App SDK exports a function called `getVincentAbilityClient` that creates a wrapper around the Vincent Ability you'd like to execute on behalf of an App User. This function returns an instance of the Ability Client with two methods that are used to execute the Ability:

1. **Precheck**: Executes the Vincent Ability's `precheck` function to provide quick and cost-free feedback on whether the Ability execution is likely to succeed. This function also:

   - Validates the Ability parameters you provide against the Vincent Ability's requirements
   - Evaluates the `precheck` function for any Vincent Policies the User has configured for your App
     - **Note:** Execution of the Ability's `precheck` logic will **not** happen unless all of the registered Vincent Policies pass their prechecks
   - Returns the results of the Vincent Ability and Policy `precheck` functions, providing context on why the precheck logic has determined Ability execution is likely to succeed or fail

2. **Execute**: Executes the Vincent Ability using the Lit Protocol network to perform the programmed ability actions on behalf of your App User. This function also:
   - Validates Ability parameters and evaluates Policies registered by the User for your App
     - **Note:** Execution of the Ability's logic will **not** happen unless all of the registered Policies permit execution
   - Executes the `commit` function of any Policies that have defined a `commit` function
     - **Note:** Policy `commit` functions give each Policy the opportunity to update any state they depend on for their policy logic after the Ability has executed successfully (e.g. a spending limit policy would update the amount the App has spent on behalf of the Vincent User after the Ability has successfully transferred funds from the User's Agent Wallet)
   - Returns the execution results of both the Ability and any evaluated Policies

# Creating a Ability Client

To create an instance of the Ability Client, import the `getVincentAbilityClient` function from the `@lit-protocol/vincent-app-sdk` package. This function takes two parameters: a Vincent Ability definition and an ethers signer, returning an instance of the Ability Client.

The following code uses an example Vincent Ability package for reference:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { getVincentAbilityClient } from '@lit-protocol/vincent-app-sdk/abilityClient';
import { bundledVincentAbility } from '@example-org/vincent-ability-example-erc20-transfer';

const ethersSigner = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.VINCENT_APP_DELEGATEE_PRIVATE_KEY);

const abilityClient = getVincentAbilityClient({
  bundledVincentAbility,
  ethersSigner,
});
```

The two required parameters for the `getVincentAbilityClient` function are:

1. `bundledVincentAbility`: The definition of the Vincent Ability you want to execute on behalf of the App User, imported from a Vincent Ability package
   - This ability definition is exported by the author of the Vincent Ability package and defines properties like the expected input parameters of the Ability, the Vincent Policies supported by the Ability, and the Ability's expected return values
   - The Ability Client handles wrapping this ability definition, providing you with a simple interface for executing the Ability, abstracting away the complexity of the Ability's implementation
2. `ethersSigner`: An Ethers.js signer that will be used to sign the request to execute the Ability using the Lit Protocol network
   - **Note:** The corresponding Ethereum address of the signer **must** be added as a delegatee for the Vincent App you are executing the Ability for. You can see how to add a delegatee to your Vincent App [here](./Creating-Apps.md#delegatee-addresses)

# Executing the Ability Client's `precheck` function

After creating an instance of the Ability Client, the `precheck` function is now configured and ready to be executed:

> **Note:** While not mandatory, it's recommended to execute the `precheck` function before every execution of the Ability Client's `execute` function as it's quick, cost-free, and can provide important context on the current state that the Ability and it's Policies depend on (e.g. the amount of funds left to spend for a spending limit policy).

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { getVincentAbilityClient } from '@lit-protocol/vincent-app-sdk/abilityClient';
import { bundledVincentAbility } from '@example-org/vincent-ability-example-erc20-transfer';

const ethersSigner = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.VINCENT_APP_DELEGATEE_PRIVATE_KEY);

const abilityClient = getVincentAbilityClient({
  bundledVincentAbility,
  ethersSigner,
});

const precheckResult = await abilityClient.precheck({
  abilityParams: {
    tokenAddress: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on Base
    recipientAddress: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
    amount: 100,
  },
  context: {
    // The ETH address of the App User's Agent Wallet you are executing the Ability on behalf of
    delegatorPkpEthAddress: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  },
});
```

The `precheck` function takes two arguments:

1. An object that contains the input parameters for the Ability that has the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `AbilityParamsSchema`

> **Note:** Because Vincent Ability definitions are strongly typed, your code editor should display the expected input parameters for the Ability
>
> If for whatever reason the type inference is not working, check the Ability's documentation for the expected input parameters

2. An object that contains:
   - `rpcUrl`: An optional parameter to override the default RPC URL used to communicate with the Lit Protocol network
     - This RPC URL is used to fetch the on-chain data about your Vincent App, what App Version (if any) the Vincent User has authorized, and the on-chain Policy parameters configured by the User for your App
     - Most developers do **not** need to provide this property, and the default RPC URL should be used
   - `delegatorPkpEthAddress`: A required parameter that is the Ethereum address of the App User's Agent Wallet you'll be executing the Ability on behalf of

## Precheck Results

<!-- TODO Link to PrecheckSuccessSchema typedoc interface when it's available -->

The return type of the `precheck` function depends on the overall success or failure of the `precheck` function, as well as the results of any evaluated Policies. If all Policies are expecting to permit Ability execution, and the Ability's `precheck` function is expecting Ability execution to succeed, the `precheck` function will return a `AbilityResponse` with a success result that has the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `PrecheckSuccessSchema`.

If `precheck` returns a success result, you can execute the Ability's `execute` function with reasonable confidence that the Ability should execute successfully.

<!-- TODO Link to PrecheckFailSchema typedoc interface when it's available -->

However, if one of the evaluated Policies returns a deny response, signifying it's expecting to deny Ability execution, or all Policies permit execution, but the Ability's `precheck` function is expecting Ability execution to fail, the `precheck` function will return a `AbilityResponse` with a failure result that has the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `PrecheckFailSchema`.

If `precheck` returns a failure result, you should check the `error` property on the result object to see if there was a known error that occurred during the execution of the Ability's `precheck` function. Additionally, if one of the evaluated Polices has denied Ability execution, you should check the result object's `context.policiesContext` property to see which Policy denied Ability execution and why.

After executing the `precheck` function and getting a success result, you can execute the Ability Client's `execute` function to perform the programmed action of the Vincent Ability.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { getVincentAbilityClient } from '@lit-protocol/vincent-app-sdk/abilityClient';
import { bundledVincentAbility } from '@example-org/vincent-ability-example-erc20-transfer';

const ethersSigner = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.VINCENT_APP_DELEGATEE_PRIVATE_KEY);

const abilityClient = getVincentAbilityClient({
  bundledVincentAbility,
  ethersSigner,
});

const executeResult = await abilityClient.execute({
  abilityParams: {
    tokenAddress: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on Base
    recipientAddress: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
    amount: 100,
  },
  context: {
    // The ETH address of the Agent Wallet you are executing the Ability on behalf of
    delegatorPkpEthAddress: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  },
});
```

The `execute` function takes two arguments similar to the `precheck` function:

1. An object that contains the input parameters for the Ability that has the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `AbilityParamsSchema`

> **Note:** Because Vincent Ability definitions are strongly typed, your code editor should display the expected input parameters for the Ability
>
> If for whatever reason the type inference is not working, check the Ability's documentation for the expected input parameters

2. An object that contains:
   - `delegatorPkpEthAddress`: A required parameter that is the Ethereum address of the Vincent User's Agent Wallet you'll be executing the Ability on behalf of

## Execute Results

The return type of the `execute` function depends on whether all evaluated Policies permitted Ability execution, as well as if the Ability's execution was successful.

If one of the Policies returns a deny response, or an error occurs during the execution of the Ability's logic, the `execute` function will return a failure result with the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `ExecuteFailSchema`.

Additionally, Vincent Policies have an optional `commit` function (as covered in the [How Vincent Policies Work](#how-the-vincent-ability-client-works) section), which is executed for each Policy that has defined a `commit` function after the Ability's logic is executed successfully. If one of the `commit` functions were to fail during execution or return a deny response, the `execute` function will return a failure result.

If all evaluated Policies permit execution, the Ability's execution is successful, and all the Policy `commit` functions are executed successfully, the `execute` function will return a success result with the structure of the Ability's Zod schema: `ExecuteSuccessSchema`.

# Wrapping Up

You now have a complete understanding of how to execute Vincent Abilities using the Ability Client. From running prechecks to evaluate Ability readiness, to executing Abilities on behalf of App Users with Policy-enforced constraints, the Ability Client simplifies the full lifecycle of Vincent Ability execution.

As a quick recap:

- Import the `bundledVincentAbility` ability definition from the Vincent Ability package you're using
- Use `getVincentAbilityClient` to create an instance of the Ability Client for a specific Vincent Ability
- Always run the `precheck` method first to validate Ability parameters, ensure all user-configured Vincent Policies permit execution, and check whether the Ability's execution is likely to succeed
- If the `precheck` passes, use the `execute` method on the Ability Client to execute the Ability’s logic
- After successful execution of the Ability's logic, any evaluated Vincent Policies with commit functions will automatically update their internal state, keeping your App compliant with the User's defined Policy limits
