# Introduction
Vincent facilitates secure interactions between you and every system your wallet or AI agents touch. It lets you grant precisely-scoped, cryptographically-enforced permissions to agents, apps, and vaults. Once these permissions are granted, you can trust that every action performed on your behalf will stay within those boundaries. 

Vincent permissions are stored on-chain and can be managed via the [heyvincent.ai](https://www.heyvincent.ai/) dashboard. The entire Vincent platform is built on and secured by Lit Protocol's [decentralized infrastructure](https://developer.litprotocol.com/resources/how-it-works).

The core unlock provided by Vincent is the secure, verifiable delegation of any Web-based operation ‚Äî most notably fully programmable, chain-agnostic, and non-custodial blockchain transactions. This is Vincent's core innovation and the functionality that makes sophisticated, AI-driven automation possible.

## How Vincent Works
The following concepts are core to how the Vincent platform operates:

### Permissions

1. üîß Tools define specific on-chain operations that can be executed on your behalf. From simple token swaps to complex multi-step DeFi strategies. Each tool can incorporate off-chain data and comes with built-in validation.

2. üõ°Ô∏è Policies are your programmable guardrails that govern when and how tools can execute. They can access real-time data from any source ‚Äî market prices, social signals, external APIs ‚Äî to make intelligent decisions about when operations should proceed.

### üì± Apps
Apps are created by third party developers and call specific functions (based on the permissions you grant) to provide you with specific functionality. The power of Vincent is that apps can only execute the specific operations you've authorized via permissions, with full transparency and verifiability.

### üîê Vincent Account
Your Vincent Account is your secure, non-custodial account(s) managed by Lit Protocol‚Äôs decentralized key management network used to facilitate secure on-chain transactions when interacting with Vincent apps.
