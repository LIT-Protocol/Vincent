title: Migrating to Production
---

Once you've completed development and testing, you're ready to publish your Vincent App to production.

<Warning>
**Prerequisites:** Complete the [Development and Testing](/app/development-and-testing) guide before migrating to production.
</Warning>

## Publishing Your App

After developing and testing your Vincent App locally, you need to publish it through the [Vincent App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai). Publishing your app to production allows it to be:

- **Discovered by users** - Your app will appear in the Vincent ecosystem for users to find
- **Permitted by users** - Users can grant your app permission to interact with their agent wallets

Visit the App Dashboard to publish your application and make it available to users.
