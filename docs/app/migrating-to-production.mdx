title: Migrating to Production
---

Once you've completed development and testing, you're ready to make your Vincent App available to users.

<Warning>
**Prerequisites:** Complete the [Creating an App](/app/creating-an-app) guide before migrating to production.
</Warning>

## Publishing Your App

During local development, your app exists only as code in your Vincent Contract. To make it available to users in the Vincent ecosystem, you need to publish it through the [Vincent App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai).

Publishing your app enables:

- **User discovery** - Your app appears in the Vincent ecosystem where users can find it
- **Permission management** - Users can grant your app access to interact with their agent wallets

The dashboard registration process allows you to provide essential metadata like your app's logo, description, and connection URLs that users will see when discovering and permitting your app.
