  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Vincent Abilities">
    After creating your Vincent App, you'll be directed to the Add Abilities page. Click the **Add Abilities to Version** button, and select your abilities to add them to your Vincent App.

    <Note>
      In this example, we will be using **ERC20 Approval** and **Uniswap Swap**.
    </Note>

    You will then want to click the **Publish App Version** button that appears below the abilities.

    Click the **Publish App Version** button to register the App Version as published in the Vincent Registry smart contract.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Permit Your App">
    On your app page, click the share button to view the Connect Page URL. Navigate to your app's Connect Page and grant permissions to your application.

    <img
      src="/images/app/publishing/image-7-1.png"

      className="rounded-lg"
