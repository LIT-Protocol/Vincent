title: 'EOA Integration'
---

Vincent integrates with traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) for direct transaction signing. EOA integration provides a simpler alternative to smart accounts when advanced features like batching or gas abstraction aren't required.

## Understanding Vincent's PKP Architecture

Vincent uses a delegation chain for secure signing:

1. **Owner EOA**: Your user's wallet - controls everything
2. **User Account (PKP)**: Controlled by the Owner EOA - authenticates the user
3. **Agent Wallet (PKP)**: Controlled by the User Account - grants signing permissions to authorized app delegatees (Ethereum addresses) that execute abilities on behalf of users

The **Agent Wallet address** is what actually signs transactions and needs to be funded with native currency for gas. This delegation chain ensures users maintain control while allowing Vincent to sign transactions securely through abilities.

## Integration Flow

  <Tab title="How It Works">
    1. **Setup the delegation chain** by creating or retrieving the Owner EOA → User Account → Agent Wallet hierarchy, and authorize your app's backend service as a delegatee (an Ethereum address permitted to execute abilities).

    2. **Fund the Agent Wallet address** with native currency for gas fees. Unlike smart accounts, EOAs must pay gas directly, so the Agent Wallet needs to hold sufficient native tokens.

    3. **Your backend delegatee generates transaction requests** such as token transfers, DeFi interactions, or contract calls that need to be executed on behalf of the user.

    4. **Your backend delegatee prepares each transaction** with proper gas estimation and nonce using your RPC provider, creating a complete transaction request ready for validation.

    5. **Your backend delegatee calls Vincent abilities** with the prepared transaction, initiating the validation and signing process.

    6. **Vincent abilities validate transactions** by simulating them on-chain and verifying they only interact with authorized contracts and benefit the user, without extracting value.

    7. **Agent Wallet signs the validated transaction** through Vincent's secure signing process, returning a standard ECDSA signature to the delegatee.

    8. **Your backend delegatee serializes and broadcasts** the signed transaction directly to the network using your RPC provider.

## Key Differences from Smart Accounts

| Feature | EOA | Smart Account |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| **Transaction Format** | Standard transaction | UserOperation |
| **Gas Payment** | Direct from account | Bundler/paymaster |
| **Broadcasting** | Direct to network | Via bundler |
| **Account Abstraction** | No | Yes |
| **Batching** | No | Yes |
| **Gas Sponsorship** | No | Yes |
