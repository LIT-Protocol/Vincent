title: 'EOA Integration'

Vincent integrates with traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) for direct transaction signing. EOA integration provides a simpler alternative to smart accounts when advanced features like batching or gas abstraction aren't required.

## Understanding Vincent's PKP Architecture

Vincent uses a delegation chain for secure signing:

1. **Owner EOA**: Your user's wallet - controls everything
2. **User PKP**: Controlled by the Owner EOA - authenticates the user
3. **Agent PKP**: Controlled by the User PKP - acts as the EOA that signs transactions

The **Agent PKP address** is what actually signs transactions and needs to be funded with native currency for gas. This delegation chain ensures users maintain control while allowing Vincent to sign transactions securely through abilities.

## Integration Flow

  <Tab title="How It Works">
    1. **Setup the delegation chain** by creating or retrieving the Owner EOA → User PKP → Agent PKP hierarchy, where the Agent PKP will act as the signing EOA.

    2. **Fund the Agent PKP address** with native currency for gas fees. Unlike smart accounts, EOAs must pay gas directly, so the Agent PKP needs to hold sufficient native tokens.

    3. **Generate transaction requests** for the Agent PKP to execute, such as token transfers, DeFi interactions, or contract calls.

    4. **Prepare each transaction** with proper gas estimation and nonce using your RPC provider, creating a complete transaction request ready for validation.

    5. **Vincent abilities validate transactions** by simulating them on-chain and verifying they only interact with authorized contracts and benefit the user, without extracting value.

    6. **Agent PKP signs the validated transaction** through Vincent's secure signing process, returning a standard ECDSA signature.

    7. **Serialize and broadcast** the signed transaction directly to the network using your RPC provider—no bundler needed for EOAs.

## Key Differences from Smart Accounts

| Feature | EOA | Smart Account |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| **Transaction Format** | Standard transaction | UserOperation |
| **Gas Payment** | Direct from account | Bundler/paymaster |
| **Broadcasting** | Direct to network | Via bundler |
| **Setup Complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **Account Abstraction** | No | Yes |
| **Batching** | No | Yes |
| **Gas Sponsorship** | No | Yes |
