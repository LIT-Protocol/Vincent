title: 'Smart Account Integration'
---

Vincent integrates with ERC-4337 smart accounts through **ZeroDev (Kernel)**, **Crossmint**, and **Safe**. Each provider has unique signature requirements and setup processes detailed in the provider-specific guides below.

## Understanding Vincent's PKP Architecture

Vincent uses a delegation chain for secure signing:

1. **Owner EOA**: Your user's wallet - controls everything
2. **User Account (PKP)**: Controlled by the Owner EOA - authenticates the user
3. **Agent Wallet (PKP)**: Controlled by the User Account - grants signing permissions to authorized app delegatees (Ethereum addresses) that execute abilities on behalf of users

The **Agent Wallet address** is added as an authorized signer to your smart account. The smart account holds funds and pays for gas through bundlers/paymasters, while the Agent Wallet signs UserOperations after Vincent validates them.

## Integration Flow

  <Tab title="How It Works">
    1. **You create a Smart Account** using a provider like [ZeroDev](https://zerodev.app/), [Biconomy](https://biconomy.io/), or [Safe](https://safe.global/), with your EOA wallet as the owner, establishing programmable control over your on-chain assets.

    2. **You grant session key permissions** to your Agent Wallet, allowing it to sign specific types of transactions on behalf of your Smart Account within defined boundaries and time limits.

    3. **You authorize your app's backend service as a delegatee** (an Ethereum address permitted to execute abilities on behalf of users through the Agent Wallet).

    4. **Your backend delegatee constructs operations** that your Smart Account should perform, such as DeFi interactions, token swaps, or cross-chain transfers, formatted as [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) UserOperations.

    5. **Your backend delegatee calls Vincent abilities** with the prepared UserOperations, initiating the validation and signing process.

    6. **Vincent abilities validate operations** by decoding the transactions, simulating them on-chain, and verifying they only interact with authorized contracts and benefit you as the user.

    7. **Agent Wallet signs validated operations** using the session key permission, creating a signed UserOperation that can be broadcast to the network through a bundler.

    8. **The Smart Account executes the operation** on-chain, with all validation logic enforced at both the Vincent ability level and the Smart Account contract level.
