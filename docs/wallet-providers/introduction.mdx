As a wallet provider, integrating Vincent allows your users to securely authorize applications to perform blockchain operations on their behalf—without giving up custody of their assets.

## The Problem

Users who want to enable automation (trading bots, DeFi agents, scheduled payments) face an impossible choice:

**Give Apps Full Control:**
- Share private keys with apps to enable automation
- Apps have unrestricted access to all funds
- Single point of failure with catastrophic risk

**Manual Approval:**
- Approve every transaction manually
- Defeats the purpose of automation
- Makes sophisticated workflows impractical

## The Vincent Solution

Vincent enables **secure automation** through scoped delegation:

- Users authorize apps to perform specific operations without sharing private keys
- Apps receive delegated signing authority through Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)
- Policies enforce exactly what operations are allowed: which contracts, functions, spending limits
- Every transaction is validated in Lit Protocol's Trusted Execution Environment
- Users can revoke access instantly

## Integration Paths

Vincent supports both smart accounts and traditional wallets:
