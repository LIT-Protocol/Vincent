## 2.1.0 (2025-09-11)

### 🚀 Features

- Refactor the Uniswap Swap Ability to utilize a prepare step which uses a Lit Action to generate and sign a Uniswap route generated by the V3 Alpha Router. The Swap Ability now intakes the signed route, validates it was signed by the expected PKP (which can only be used to sign the generated Uniswap routes within the prepare Lit Action), then uses the provided route to create and sign the Uniswap Swap transaction with the Agent Wallet PKP. The Uniswap Swap Ability was also updated to no longer support the Spending Limit Policy, and currently doesn't support any Policies.
