## 2.2.0 (2025-09-11)

### üöÄ Features

- Refactor the Uniswap Swap Ability to utilize a prepare step which uses a Lit Action to generate and sign a Uniswap route generated by the V3 Alpha Router. The Swap Ability now intakes the signed route, validates it was signed by the expected PKP (which can only be used to sign the generated Uniswap routes within the prepare Lit Action), then uses the provided route to create and sign the Uniswap Swap transaction with the Agent Wallet PKP. The Uniswap Swap Ability was also updated to no longer support the Spending Limit Policy, and currently doesn't support any Policies.

## 2.1.0 (2025-08-15)

### üöÄ Features

- ## Add gas sponsorship for LIT chain usage by delegatees ([3d693e16](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/3d693e16))
  - New endpoint added (`/app/{appId}/sponsorDelegateesPayment`) which sponsors gas usage on Yellowstone for all delegateeAddresses on the target app

# 2.0.0 (2025-08-05)

### üöÄ Features

- ### Add logo support for abilities and policies ([6ef30e41](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/6ef30e41))
  - Defined a new optional `logo` property for both abilities and policies models
  - Implemented `logo` property support when creating abilities & policies

- Define explicit `setActiveVersion` route handler for app entity ([6aa13539](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/6aa13539))

### ü©π Fixes

- Modify delete and undelete logic to leave child entity documents alone ([afc5a72a](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/afc5a72a))

  This fixes a case where deleting then undeleting an appVersion would leave AppVersionAbilities in an inconsistent state relative to on-chain state.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Add integration with chain data to restrict operations on entities that have been published on-chain ([2395c577](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/2395c577))

  Implemented on-chain check for random appId selection that runs before we create the app in the registry

- ### JWT authentication ([c48a9097](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/c48a9097))

  #### App owners, ability and policy authors now use JWT authentication via PKPs to auth with the registry
  - Implemented express authentication using the new non-app-specific JWT code from `app-sdk`
  - All edits to apps, abilities and policies are now based on the `pkp.ethAddress` in the JWT instead of a signed SIWE

- #### uiSchema and jsonSchema handling ([e342fff9](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/e342fff9))
  - Updated registry backend processing to import `uiSchema` and `jsonSchema` values for policies from `dist/src/inputUiSchema.json` instead of `dist/src/generated/vincent-policy-metadata.json`.
  - These values aren't really generated code and aren't computed metadata; they are managed by the policy author so having them in the same file that is generated by bundling logic was sub-optimal

### üöÄ Features

- #### Support `deploymentStatus` for Abilities and Policies ([e50ded25](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/e50ded25))
  - Implemented support for the `deploymentStatus` property for Ability and Policy.
  - It defaults to `dev` for new entities.

## 1.2.0 (2025-06-29)

### üöÄ Features

- ### Implement undelete routes for deletable entities ([f5ef06de](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/f5ef06de))
  - Added route handlers to support undeletion of `App`, `AppVersion`, `AppVersionAbility`, `Ability`, `AbilityVersion, `Policy`, and `PolicyVersion`

### ü©π Fixes

## 1.1.0 (2025-06-28)

### üöÄ Features

- ### Implement new delete endpoints ([e471c780](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/e471c780))
  - Implemented delete endpoints for AppVersion, and AppAbilityVersion, PolicyVersion, and AbilityVersion
  - Updated integration tests to verify the new routes functionality and security / authorization constraints

### ü©π Fixes

- ### Bug Fix ([8d646d44](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/8d646d44))

  - Added explicit integration tests to verify changeOwner is working as expected, in the authorization suite

- Updated registry-sdk to 3.1.0

# 1.0.0 (2025-06-28)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- #### Add SIWE authentication ([e3d7c886](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/e3d7c886))
  - Defined a new `siweAuth` securitySchema and applied it to all PUT, POST and DELETE endpoints
  - SIWE auth is a custom Authorization scheme, using the prefix `SIWE:`, but is considered an `apiKey` semantically for compatibility purposes
  - Implemented Metamask integration for getting SIWEs in the RapiDoc UI so we can still use it to test endpoints directly
  - Added server selection to the RapiDoc endpoint
  - Add authentication checks to all mutation endpoints in the registry backend. Wallet A cannot edit Wallet B's resources.
    **- Owner and manager wallet can no longer be provided as arguments in the endpoint payloads; they are always set during creation by getting the address of the signed SIWE**
  - Implement integration test suite that verifies they are working as expected
  - Updated tooling in the registry-backend to use the RapiDoc code that is in the registry-sdk instead of in-lining its own inside the express route

  ### Define tags per endpoint to support automatic cache invalidation
  - Defined `tags` for all endpoints
  - The RTK query client will now automatically refetch data for any existing subscriptions when a mutation occurs
  - The tags are extremely simplistic, generic, and pessimistic. Basically, when an entity changes we reload all data for all entities of the same time. We will make this less pessimistic by using `.enhanceEndpoints` in a follow-up release.

  ### Internal
  - Added `debug` package and implemented trace logging that can be toggled on per module by setting the appropriate path in the DEBUG env var.
  - Replaced 'verboseLog()' functionality in the tests with usage of `debug()`
  - Added logging to middleware to help verify they are all functioning as expected

## 0.2.1 (2025-06-26)

### ü©π Fixes

- Fix mkdtemp not found in production deployment to Heroku ([92733bbd](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/92733bbd))
  - The ESM version of `fs-extra` doesn't pass through methods through; when we deploy to production, that's the package that gets used
  - This was working coincidentally for local dev because of transpilation / CJS references. :sad_panda:
