# 2.0.0 (2025-08-05)

### üöÄ Features

- Add validateAbilityExecutionAndGetPolicies() method ([176e2023](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/176e2023))
- Add CBOR2 encoding to policy parameter persistence and loading from the chain ([4f592cea](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/4f592cea))

### ü©π Fixes

- #### Policy Param Parsing Fixes ([16470065](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/16470065))

  - Resolves some inconsistencies in Policy Parameter parsing so that policies can be enabled but have no parameters
  - Removed dynamic imports
  - Replaced `Buffer` dependency with ethers.utils.hexlify usage

- ### Enable typedoc generation for the contracts-sdk ([bcf9244c](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/bcf9244c))
- Return null from getAppVersion() if the error is an AppNotRegistered error (previously only did this for AppVersionNotRegistered) ([176e2023](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/176e2023))
- De-dupe definitions in our combined Vincent Diamond ABI to avoid being spammed by logging from ethers about the duplication ([176e2023](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/176e2023))

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- #### API changes for v1.0 ([aedcd1b7](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/aedcd1b7))

  - Numbers instead of strings for things that are numeric but won't be big enough to require BigInt
  - Renamed some arguments to be more explicit e.g. 'xxx'->xxxAddress
  - getAppsByManager() -> getAppsByManagerAddress()
  - getAppByDelegatee() -> getAppByDelegateeAddress()
  - Modified interfaces that took and returned pkpTokenIds to take and return pkpEthAddresses instead
  - Used partial ABI of pkpRouter contract to avoid bringing in multiple MB of contracts-sdk ABIs
  - getDelegatedAgentPkpTokenIds() -> getDelegatedPkpEthAddresses()
  - getAllRegisteredAgentPkps() -> getAllRegisteredAgentPkpEthAddresses()
  - Optional pageOpts for fetching pages of pkpEthAddresses, with optional offset and limit - default page size is 100
  - `overrides` is now correctly defined as an Ethers.Overrides type
  - Added some internal types for contract results to be sure we're sane in our usage
  - Removed `success` property from responses of methods that returned `{ txHash, success }` - it was redundant - there was no way `success` could ever be anything other than `true`.
  - Removed logic in `registerNextVersion() that would return `-1` for newAppVersion in cases where we couldn't identify what it was, and instead threw an explicit error
  - Return an empty array for collection methods that might have no results instead of reverting

- #### Support dev and prod contracts ([5262c600](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/5262c600))

  - Refactored to export methods for creating a ContractClient instance instead of flat, raw methods list
  - `getTestClient({ signer })` for CI or dev usage where you don't care about the data being kept around
  - `getClient({ signer })` for production usage where you care about the data

  #### Internal method for interacting with local chain instances

  - `clientFromContract({ contract })` allows a completely custom contract to be provided, for cases where we may running entirely local chain instance w/ custom addresses or contract implementations.
