# Why Vincent?

# Overview

Vincent enables user's to delegate their wallets to Agentic applications for autonomous signing. Users can precisely define the scope of their delegation. For example, a delegated agent can sign only Uniswap swap transactions for a max of $100/day but it won't be able to sign any other type of transactions or exceed the spend limit set by the user. App delegations are stored the [Yellowstone](https://developer.litprotocol.com/connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone) blockchain and the Agent Wallets are managed by [Lit Protocol](https://developer.litprotocol.com/) which is an MPC TSS network.
